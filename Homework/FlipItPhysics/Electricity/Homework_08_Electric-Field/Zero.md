## Zero
Two charges are fixed in place on the \[x\]-axis as shown. 

* Let 
  * \[-q = 2.0&mu;\] be the magnitude of the ***negative*** red charge on the left.
  * \[+Q = 4.0&mu;\] be the magnitude of the ***positive*** blue charge on the right.
  * \[x = d = 12.0 cm\] be the destance between the charges.

* Find
  * a point \[x = x<sub>0</sub>\] along the \[x\]-axis at which the electric field is zero.

* 0 =
|k (Q)(x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)|
|-------------------|
||
-

\left(\frac{ Q}{ \left(x + x<sub>0</sub>\right)x<sub>2</sub>\right)\right) \]
      * Solve for \[x<sub>0</sub>\]
* x<sub>0</sub> = -28.9706


0 = k \frac{q}{ h^2} - k \frac{Q}{(r + h)^2}  
vs  
\[0 = k \left(\left(\frac{ q_1}{ h^2}\right) - \left(\frac{ q_2}{ \left(r + h\right)^2\right)\right) \]

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
