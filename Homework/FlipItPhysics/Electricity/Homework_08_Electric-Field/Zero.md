## Zero
Two charges are fixed in place on the \[x\]-axis as shown. 

* Let 
  * \[q<sub>0</sub> = -2.0 &alpha c\] be the red charge on the left.
  * \[Q = 4.0 &mu c\] be the blue charge on the right.
  * \[r = d = 12.0 cm\] be the destance be btween the charges.
&#924
Find \[h\] along the \[x\]-axis such that the electric 
field is zero.

* \[x<sub>0</sub> = -28.9706\]
  * \[0 = k \left(\left(\frac{ q_1}{ h^2}\right) - \left(\frac{ q_2}{ \left(r + h\right)^2\right)\right) \]
      * Solve for \[-h\]

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
