## Zero
Two charges are fixed in place on the \[x\]-axis as shown. 

* Let 
  * \[k = boltzmann constant] be 1.38
  * \[-q = 2.0&mu;\] be the magnitude of the ***negative*** red charge on the left.
  * \[+Q = 4.0&mu;\] be the magnitude of the ***positive*** blue charge on the right.
  * \[x = d = 12.0 cm\] be the destance between the charges.

* Find
  * a point \[x = x<sub>0</sub>\] along the \[x\]-axis at which the electric field is zero.

* 0 = k \[ {q &frasl; (x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> } - {Q &frasl; (x + x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> } \]

      * Solve for \[x<sub>0</sub>\]
* x<sub>0</sub> = -28.9706
